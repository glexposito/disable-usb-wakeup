## Installation
The installation script creates and enables a Linux service using systemd, specifically to address the issue of the Logi Bolt dongle waking up immediately after the PC enters sleep mode in Arch Linux. This script disables USB wakeup functionality.

To install, execute the following command: 

```shell
sudo sh install.sh
```

To uninstall, execute the following command: 

```shell
sudo sh uninstall.sh
```
